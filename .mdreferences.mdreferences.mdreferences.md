[32m+ _Good job! You've solved a merge conflict! :tada:_[m
[32m+ [m
[32m+ Resolving a conflict doesn't automatically merge the pull request in GitHub. Instead, it stores the resolution of the conflict in a merge commit and allows you and your team to keep working. To resolve a conflict, GitHub performs what is known as a _reverse merge_. This means that the changes from the `main` branch were merged into your `my-resume` branch. With a reverse merge, only the `my-resume` branch is updated. This allows you to test the resolved changes on your branch before you merge it into `main`.[m

[32m+ 1. Browse to the `my-resume` branch.[m
[32m+ 1. Click the `Add file` dropdown menu and then on `Create new file`.[m
[32m+ 1. Create a file named `references.md`.[m
[32m+ 1. Enter some text that conflicts with what we added for `references.md` in the `main` branch.[m
[32m+ 1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and enter a commit message for your change.[m
[32m+ 1. Click the **Commit new file** button, making sure the "Commit directly to the `my-resume` branch" option is selected.[m
